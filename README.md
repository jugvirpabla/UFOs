## Further Recommdations:
Something that can be added to this website to make it even better, would be links to articles that are related to the UFO sightings. This way the reader(s) can get even more information about certain UFO sightings. 

Another element that can be added to this website, is a search by comment keywords feature. By this I mean, the ability to search for a word or phrase that is in the comments of the UFO sightings.
